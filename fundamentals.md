# SQL Server Query Optimizer

Think of the **Query Optimizer** like a navigation app (such as Google Maps). It finds the best way to get from point A to point B, considering multiple factors to determine the optimal route. Similarly, the Query Optimizer evaluates different strategies to execute a SQL query efficiently.

## Analogy: Google Maps and Query Optimization

Imagine planning a road trip from **Salzburg, Austria**, to **Disneyland Paris**. Google Maps offers the best routes considering various factors:

1. **Distance**: The shortest route might not always be the fastest.
2. **Road Type**: Highways are generally faster than local roads.
3. **Traffic Conditions**: Accidents, roadworks, or traffic jams can affect travel time.
4. **Time of Day**: Driving during peak hours can cause delays.

### How the Query Optimizer Works

Similarly, the **Query Optimizer** in SQL Server:

- **Evaluates multiple execution plans** for a given query.
- **Estimates the cost** of each plan based on available data (like table size, indexes, and statistics).
- **Chooses the plan with the lowest cost** to optimize query performance.

However, this optimization must occur within a limited time frame, similar to how Google Maps generates a route within a few seconds. SQL Server aims to balance efficiency with quick response times.

## The Role of Accurate Metadata

Just as Google Maps relies on up-to-date traffic and road information, SQL Server’s Query Optimizer relies on **metadata** like statistics to generate efficient execution plans. These statistics provide insights into the distribution of data within tables, allowing the optimizer to estimate query costs more accurately.

### Key Metadata Elements

- **Statistics**: Crucial for the optimizer to make informed decisions about:
  - Which indexes to use
  - How to join tables
  - How much data to scan

## Order of Evaluation in T-SQL Statements

It’s important to understand that the way you write **T-SQL statements** differs from the way SQL Server processes them. Let’s break down the evaluation order:
## Example Query: Filtering, Grouping, and Sorting Data

The following query retrieves the **top 10 employees** who have processed the most orders since **January 1, 2023**, with each having processed more than 5 orders.

### SQL Query

```sql
SELECT TOP 10 EmployeeID, COUNT(OrderID) 
FROM Orders 
WHERE OrderDate >= '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY EmployeeID
HAVING COUNT(OrderID) > 5
ORDER BY COUNT(OrderID) DESC;
```
## Order of Evaluation in the SQL Query

When executing the query, SQL Server processes the query in the following order:

1. **FROM**: SQL Server starts by identifying which tables to access (i.e., `Orders` table).
2. **WHERE**: Filters data based on conditions (e.g., orders from **2023 onwards**).
3. **GROUP BY**: Groups the filtered data (e.g., by `EmployeeID`).
4. **HAVING**: Applies conditions to the grouped data (e.g., employees with **more than 5 orders**).
5. **SELECT**: Retrieves specific columns from the grouped data.
6. **ORDER BY**: Sorts the final result set in the specified order (e.g., by the count of `OrderID`).
7. **TOP**: Limits the result set to the top **N records** (e.g., top 10).

# SQL Server Statistics

In SQL Server, **statistics** are a collection of information that describes the distribution of data in a column (or a combination of columns) within a table or index. These statistics are essential for the **Query Optimizer** to estimate how many rows a query will return, which in turn helps it decide the most efficient way to execute the query.

## Key Concepts of Statistics

- **Data Distribution**: Statistics consist of a **histogram** that represents the data distribution for a column and **density information** for indexed columns.
- **Optimizer Assistance**: Statistics help the Query Optimizer predict important factors, such as:
  - **Selectivity**: How many rows match a particular filter condition.
  - **Cardinality**: The estimated number of rows returned by a query.

### Why Statistics Matter

- **Improved Query Performance**: Accurate statistics allow SQL Server to choose the most efficient execution plan.
- **Essential for Complex Queries**: For complex queries involving multiple tables and indexes, statistics provide crucial guidance to the Query Optimizer.

### Example: How Statistics Influence Query Optimization

When a query includes a filter condition, SQL Server uses statistics to assess the **selectivity** of that condition. For example, if filtering by `City = 'New York'`, the Query Optimizer checks the histogram data for the `City` column to estimate how many rows will match this condition, which influences whether to use an index or a table scan.

### Notes:
- Statistics are automatically created and maintained by SQL Server for indexed columns.
- Regularly updating statistics is essential for optimal query performance, especially in frequently updated tables.

# Summary: The Role of Statistics in SQL Server

Statistics help the **Query Optimizer** decide the best way to execute a query efficiently. They are crucial for:

- **Index Usage**: Assisting the optimizer in selecting the most appropriate indexes.
- **Join Selection**: Determining the best join strategies for complex queries.
- **Query Plan Efficiency**: Improving the overall performance of query execution plans.

## Key Concepts

- **Histograms**: Summarize the distribution of data in a column, divided into up to **200 steps**.
- **Density Vectors**: Help the optimizer understand value uniqueness for better **cardinality estimates**.

## Best Practices

- **Regularly Update Statistics**: Especially important for large tables with frequent data changes.
  - Use manual updates for critical tables:
    ```sql
    UPDATE STATISTICS table_name;
    EXEC sp_updatestats;
    ```
## Manually Updating Statistics with Full Scan

In some cases, particularly with **large tables** that undergo frequent data changes, it's essential to update statistics to ensure accurate query optimization. The `WITH FULLSCAN` option forces a full scan of the table, resulting in the most accurate statistics.
## Explanation of `UPDATE STATISTICS` with `FULLSCAN`

### Explanation

- **`UPDATE STATISTICS`**: Updates the statistics for the specified table.
- **`WITH FULLSCAN`**: Performs a full scan of the table to gather the most precise data distribution information.

### When to Use `WITH FULLSCAN`

- **Large tables** with frequent inserts, updates, or deletes.
- When you notice **performance degradation** due to outdated statistics.
- To ensure **optimal query plans** for critical reports or complex queries.

### Notes

- Using **`FULLSCAN`** can be **resource-intensive**, so it’s best to schedule it during off-peak hours.
- Regularly updating statistics with a full scan is recommended for tables with **highly dynamic data** to maintain query performance.

### Example Command

```sql
UPDATE STATISTICS table_name WITH FULLSCAN;
```
## Checking the Last Update Date of Statistics

To determine when statistics were last updated for tables in your database, use the following query. This can help identify outdated statistics that may need refreshing for optimal query performance.

### SQL Query

```sql
SELECT name, STATS_DATE(object_id, stats_id) AS last_updated
FROM sys.stats;
```
## Explanation of Checking Statistics Update Date

### Explanation

- **`name`**: The name of the statistics object.
- **`STATS_DATE(object_id, stats_id)`**: Returns the last date on which the statistics were updated for each object.
- **`sys.stats`**: A system catalog view that contains information on statistics for tables and indexed views.

### Usage Tips

- Use this query to **identify stale statistics** that may need updating.
- Regularly monitor the `last_updated` date, especially for tables with **frequent data modifications**.

### Notes

- **Outdated statistics** can lead to suboptimal query plans and performance issues.
- Consider scheduling **manual updates** for critical statistics that haven’t been refreshed recently.
